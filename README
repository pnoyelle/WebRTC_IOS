# Build of Webrtc for IOS

## simulator and arm64 for m1 mac

to be able to compile for arm 64 simulator i had to modify `src/build/config/ios/BUILD.gn` :

```
target_environment = "simulator"
ios_sdk_path = "/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/iPhoneSimulator.platform/Developer/SDKs/iPhoneSimulator14.5.sdk"
```

(check the iphone simulator version) and run an arm 64 build.
this generate the ARM64 binary that can be merged (with lipo) to the xcframework simulator binary.

`python src/tools_webrtc/ios/build_ios_libs.py  --bitcode --arch arm64 -o testb/ios_x64 --build_config release`
